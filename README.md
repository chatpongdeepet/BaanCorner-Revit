---

## üìñ Description  

**Unit Converter** is a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application developed using **.NET Framework 4.8** and implemented in **C# 13.0**. The application is designed for managing and configuring project units across various disciplines efficiently. It supports importing, exporting, and modifying unit formats for common and discipline-specific configurations such as electrical units.

## üõ† Features  

- **Unit Import/Export**:  
  - Allows the export of project unit configurations to a file.  
  - Provides an option to import unit configurations from an external file and apply them to the project.  

- **Discipline-Based Configuration**:  
  - Units are categorized into disciplines such as **Common** and **Electrical** for organized and efficient management.  

- **Editable Unit Settings**:  
  - Modify unit formats using dropdowns (e.g., ComboBoxes) for different disciplines like `Common` and `Electrical`.  

- **Interactive UI**:  
  - Intuitive and modern UI with features like tabs for different disciplines and custom-styled buttons with icons for easy navigation.

## üìÅ Project Structure  

1. **UI Components**:  
   - The main UI layout is defined in `UnitConverter.xaml`.  
   - It uses a `TabControl` structure where each tab represents a discipline.  
   - `DataGrid` components are provided for unit editing, with columns for Unit Names and Format options.

2. **Logical Components**:  
   - The main functionalities, such as importing, exporting, and updating unit configurations, are implemented in `UnitConverter.xaml.cs`.  
   - The application uses models like the `Unit` class to represent individual project units.
